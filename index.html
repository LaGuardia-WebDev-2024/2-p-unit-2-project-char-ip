                        Oh... the music. Listen to it... Are you crying?
                        <br><br> Nothing's ever just the wind.
                        <br><br>Why are you sad?
                        <br><br>I told you, my diary's nearly full. I worry.
                        <br><br> There are stories about us, you know.
                        <br><br> I look them up sometimes.
                        <br><br>Some of them suggest that the very last night we spend together is at the Singing Towers of Darillium. That wouldn't be true, would it?
                        <br><br>Oh. Well, that would explain why you kept cancelling coming here. Do you remember that time-
                        <br><br> When there were two of you-
                        <br><br>Because I want you to know that if this is the last night, I expect you to find a way round it.
                        <br><br>But you're you. There's always a loophole. You wait until the last minute and then you spring it on me.
                        <br><br> But you will. You'll wait until I've given up hope. All will be lost, and you'll do that smug little smile and then you'll save the day. You always do.
                        <br><br><br>No, Doctor, you're wrong. Happy ever after doesn't mean forever. It just means time. A little time. But that's not the sort of thing you could ever understand, is it?
                        <br><br>I love them.
                        <br><br>They're ignoring me. But then you can't expect a monolith to love you back.

                        <br><br><br>Mmm. What do you think of the towers?
                        <br><br> Then why are you ignoring them?
                        <br><br>No, you can't.
                        <br>They've been there for millions of years, through storms and floods and wars and time.
                        Nobody really understands where the music comes from.
                        It's probably something to do with the precise positions, the distance between both towers.
                        Even the locals aren't sure.
                        All anyone will ever tell you is that when the wind stands fair and the night is perfect, when you least expect it but always when you need it the most...

                EP: Silence In the Library (see the backside of the left flap)
                <br>The first appearance of Professor River Song in the show, she speaks of Darillium, and the towers, and The Doctor crying.
                <br>However on a chronological standpoint, her words mean nothing. Her story is yet to be told.
            </p>
            <h5>THIS EP IS SO MUCH SADDER ON REWATCH OHHH MY GOSH THIS IS SO TRAGIC.
                Can you imagine loving a man ever since birth and yet on your final day you see him again; younger than ever, and doesn't even know you.
                No memories together, no recollection of you. And you die alongside your husband, but it isn't him- hes just a stranger.</h5>

                EP: The Wedding of River Song 
                <br>This is when The Doctor tells her his name (something that people of his race (hes an alien btw) don't do since their real native names are extremely sacred)
            </p>
            <h5>THIS IS SO CRAZY CUTE UGH. River Song's involvment in The Doctor's life is so insane because he was there for her birth (this was after they got married),
                she was trained to KILL The Doctor, and then be friends with The Doctor's human friends, THEN KILL HIM (after a while, time travel is weird),
                and then serve time in jail she technically didn't do.
